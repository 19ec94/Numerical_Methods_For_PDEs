# Exercise in C: Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations

This repository contains implementations of numerical methods for solving various types of partial differential equations (PDEs) using the C programming language.

## Contents

Each directory contains code and resources for a specific numerical method or PDE problem:

- **1_Taylors_table_in_c**: Taylor's table method implementation in C.
- **2_Crank_Nikolson_Scheme**: Crank-Nicolson scheme for solving PDEs.
- **3_Advection_Equation_in_2D**: Numerical solution for the 2D advection equation.
- **4_Burgers_Equation_in_2D**: Numerical solution for the 2D Burgers' equation.
- **5_Euler_Equations_in_2D**: Numerical solution for the 2D Euler equations.
- **6_FEM_1D**: Finite Element Method (FEM) implementation for 1D problems.
- **7_FEM_2D**: Finite Element Method (FEM) implementation for 2D problems.

## Usage

1. **Navigate** to the directory of the method you want to run.
2. **Compile** the C code using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`).
      ```gcc main.c -o output```
3. **Run** the compiled program.
*(Replace `main.c` and `output` with the actual file names as needed.)*

## Requirements

- **C Compiler** (such as GCC or Clang)
- **Basic knowledge of numerical methods and PDEs**
